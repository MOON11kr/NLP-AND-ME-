SAMPLE_RESUME = """
I am a data analyst with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and Pandas.
I have built and deployed machine learning models using TensorFlow and
Scikit-learn. My work includes classification tasks, regression analysis,
and data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

I am also familiar with NLP techniques like text preprocessing, sentiment
analysis, and using transformer models such as BERT. I’ve contributed to
web apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and used GitHub for version
control.

In teams, I demonstrate strong communication and leadership skills. I’ve
worked on projects that required critical thinking, time management, and
cross-functional collaboration.
